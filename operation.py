# Arithmetic operators - used with numeric values to preform common math operations

x = 1
y = 2
res = 0

res = x + y
print(res)

res = x - y
print(res)

res = x * y  # multiplication
print(res)

res = x / y  # division
print(res)

res = x % y  # MODULUS - removes the remainder after division
print(res)

res = x ** y # Exponentation -> x to the power of y
print(res)

res = x // y # FLOOR DIVISION - divide and drop the decimal
print(res)


# Assignment operator - used to assign values to variables
# +=, -=, *=, /=

z = 5
z += 5
z -= 3
z *= 3
z /= 2
print(z)

# comparison operator - used to compare two values, same as if and else
# == (Equal to), != (not equal), < > (greater than/lessthan) <= >=

# Logical Operator- used to combine conditional statements
# used with True/False value like conditions
# and -> both must be True
# or -> at least one must be True
# not -> flips True to False (vice versa)

x = 3 
y = 10
z = 10

print(x == y and z == y) # False, because both conditions are NOT true
print(x == y or y == z)  # True, because at least one condition is True
print(not x == y)        # True, because x not equal to y

# Identity operator- used to compare the objects, not if they're equal but
# if they're actaully the same object with the same memory location
# is -> check if two things are the exact same
# is not -> Checks if they are NOT the same

x = 3
y = 3
print(x is y)       # Returns True if both variables are the same object
print(x is not y)   # Returns True if both variables are NOT the same object

# Membership Operator - used to test if a sqwuence is presented in an object
# in -> checks if something exist inside a sequence(list, string, ect...)
# not in -> checks if something dose NOT exist inside

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

print(4 in x)      # True, because 4 is inside the list
print(9 not in x)  # True, because 9 is NOT inside the list
