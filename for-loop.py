"""
A for loop in python is a control structure that lets you repeat a block of code 
for each item in a sequence (such as list, string, tuple, range of numbers...)

It's used when you know how many times you want to repeat an action or when
you want to process each element in a collection.

for variable in sequence:
    # code block runs for each item in the sequence

# loop through a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

    print(fruit)

# loop through a string

    print(letter)

print("--------------------------------------")

for x in range(5):  # 1 number sets where the range stops by index

1. Ask the user to enter a number and store it in a variable called num.
2. Use a for loop with range(1, 11) to repeat 10 times (from 1 to 10)
3. inside the loop, multiply num by the current loop value (i)
