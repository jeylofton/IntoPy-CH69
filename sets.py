MINI CHALLENGE: STUDY GROUPS
-------------------------------
Two study groups are preparing for an exam.
1. Create two sets:
    - group_a = {"Leo", "Sam", "Alex", "Nina"}
    - group_b = {"Nina", "Jordan", "Sam", "Taylor"}
2. Print:
    - All students participating in either group (union)
    - Students who are in BOTH groups (intersection)
    - Students who are only in group_a (difference)
3. Add "Maya" to group_a.
4. Remove "Jordan" from group_b.
5. Print the total number of unique students across both groups.
6. If "Nina" is in both groups,
      print("Nina is helping both groups!")
   Otherwise,
      print("Nina is only in one group.")
7. Print the final version of both sets.
